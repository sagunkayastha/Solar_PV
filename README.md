# Solar Power Requirements Calculator
This program Calculates Solar Power Requirements and plots: <br>
1: Number of Battery and their connections. <br>
2: Number of Solar panels their connections.<br>

The calculations are based on : <br>
1: How much energy appliance(s) use over a period of time?  <br>
2: Inverter Efficiency <br>
3: Battery type and Storage Temperature (Maximum Depth of Discharge)  <br>
4: Solar Panel type <br> 


<pre>
The Program contains predefined values for sepcific type of Batteries and Solar Panels, like: <br>
Batteries :  Conorde PVX 5040, Trojan T-105, Trojan L16, Conorde PVX 1080, Surette 12CS11PS <br> 
Solar Panels :  Kyocera, Sharp, BP, Uni-Solar, Shell
